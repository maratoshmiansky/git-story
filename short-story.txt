There was a little boy named Henry who wished and hoped more than anything to be a poet.  He had no idea how to make money writing poetry in the real world and had only ever written poetry as a hobby.  But now a desire arose within Edgar to spread his wings and learn to write poetry like an expert.  Ergo, Edgar enrolled in the Actualize coding bootcamp and started classes so he could write poetry in his free time.

There was a little boy named Henry who wished and hoped more than anything to be a coder.  He had no idea how to code in the real world and had only ever coded as a hobby.  But now a desire arose within Edgar to spread his wings and learn to code like an expert.  Ergo, Edgar enrolled in the Actualize coding bootcamp and started classes.
